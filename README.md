# JAVASCRIPT-PROJECTS
Welcome to my JavaScript learning portfolio! This repo contains hands-on projects built during my Tech Academy AI Developer Bootcamp. Each project focuses on **fundamentals**, **modern standards**, and **real-world relevance** — often inspired by the produce industry.

# Learning Goals 
- Build confidence with JavaScript syntax and logic
- Understand how JS powers interactivity
- Prepare for deeper topics like APIs, libraries, and AI integration


## What You'll Find

- Simple, readable JavaScript code
- Projects that connect to HTML/CSS layouts
- Real-world examples like:
  - Price calculators for seasonal produce
  - Form validation for market vendors
  - Interactive dashboards for trend tracking

## Core Concepts Practiced

- Variables (`let`, `const`)
- Data types (strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects)
- Functions and return values
- DOM manipulation (connecting JS to HTML)
- Event listeners (clicks, inputs)
- Basic conditionals and loops

## Coding Standards

- Clean naming conventions (`camelCase`)
- Semantic structure and accessibility
- DRY principles (Don’t Repeat Yourself)
- Comments for clarity
- Mobile-friendly layout integration
