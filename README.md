# JAVASCRIPT-PROJECTS

Welcome to my JavaScript learning portfolio! This repo contains hands-on projects built during my Tech Academy AI Developer Bootcamp. Each project focuses on fundamentals, modern standards, and real-world relevance — often inspired by the produce industry.

## Learning Goals
* Build confidence with JavaScript syntax and logic
* Understand how JS powers interactivity
* Prepare for deeper topics like APIs, libraries, and AI integration

## What You'll Find
* Simple, readable JavaScript code
* Projects that connect to HTML/CSS layouts

## Projects

### Simple Calculator
A basic arithmetic calculator demonstrating fundamental JavaScript operations and DOM manipulation. Features addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with a clean, functional interface.

**Key elements:** Event listeners, conditional logic, DOM updates, input validation

### Pizza Menu Order
An interactive order form that calculates pizza prices based on size and toppings selected. Demonstrates dynamic pricing logic and user input handling.

**Key elements:** Form inputs, checkbox/radio button handling, price calculation functions, real-time display updates

### Tic Tac Toe (Produce Version)
A playful twist on the classic game featuring produce-themed markers. Includes win condition checking and game state management.

**Key elements:** Array manipulation, game logic algorithms, player turn management, win/draw detection, DOM grid interaction

### To-Do App
A task management application allowing users to add, complete, and remove items from their list. Demonstrates practical list manipulation and persistent state handling.

**Key elements:** Array methods (push, splice, filter), dynamic list rendering, event delegation, toggle functionality

## Core Concepts Practiced
* Variables (`let`, `const`)
* Data types (strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects)
* Functions and return values
* DOM manipulation (connecting JS to HTML)
* Event listeners (clicks, inputs)
* Basic conditionals and loops

## Coding Standards
* Clean naming conventions (`camelCase`)
* Semantic structure and accessibility
* DRY principles (Don't Repeat Yourself)
* Comments for clarity
* Mobile-friendly layout integration
